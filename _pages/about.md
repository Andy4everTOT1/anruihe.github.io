I am an MS student at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, advised by Prof. [Mike Zheng Shou](https://github.com/showlab). Prior to NUS, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from **Zhejiang University**, where I was advised by Prof. Juncheng Li.

My research lies at the intersection of **embodied AI**, **multimodal large language models**, and **3D scene understanding**. I am passionate about building AI systems that can perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. I have co-authored papers on mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs and developing real-time scene understanding systems integrated into wearable smart-vision aids.
